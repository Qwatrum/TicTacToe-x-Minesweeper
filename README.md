# TicTacToe x Minesweeper

- A Minesweeper like game but with the aspect of TicTacToe
- You need to click every allowed field.
- A field is allowed when it's either a space or your allowed letter.
- But each field, is like in minesweeper covered.
- Your allowed letter is the first one you click. For example you click a field where a X is, then all Xs and spaces are allowed.
- Clicking an unallowed field ends the game.
- Click every allowed field and you win!


- This game has nothing to do with the orignal minesweeper!
